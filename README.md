# DOMW (DevOps Mid-West) Sample App

First of all, thanks for attending our talk!  During this hands-on workshop, we will be using this code to teach you the following objectives:

  * Take an existing applicaiton and containerize it
  * Realize the portability of containers
  * Host your containerized application in a serverless environment
  * Scale your deployment to handle production-level volumes

# Prerequisites

  * [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  * An [AWS Account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup?nc2=h_ct&src=header_signup&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fregistration-confirmation#/start/email)
  * [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
  * An [internet](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+the+internet&oq=what+is+the+internet) connection


# Containerizing Your Application

Containers are similar to little virtual machines capable of running your applications. In this workshop, we will take an existing application and show how you prepare it to run inside of a container.
